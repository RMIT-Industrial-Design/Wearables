# ThinkTank: Wearables
RMIT Digital Practice Design Studio 2018
School of Design

This repository contains code, circuits and other information that may be useful in the development and prototyping of wearable devices.
The repository supports the Think Tank: Wearables 2018 undergraduate design studio and is the collective effort of staff and students within the Industrial Design program at RMIT University. This studio investigates the body as a site of technological intervention. Looking beyond current trends of smart watches and activity trackers, we imagine a future where computing power is distributed through and across bodies, opening up new lines of communication, representation, aggregation and augmentation.
The information presented here uses Arduino and Arduino-like platforms for quick prototyping development.

## How to contribute.
To contribute to a piece of code, or the whole repository, follow this procedure:
1. Sign up for GitHub.
- Provide an email, user name, and password.
2. Create a Fork of the Wearables repository.
- Once you have an account, you will need to create your own 'fork' of the Wearables project. Do this by clicking the 'Fork' button (top right). This will create a copy of the current master in your own GitHub account. Changes you make to these files will only be reflected in your own account. When you are ready to contribute back to the Wearables source code you open a Pull Request.
3. Create a local copy of the repository.
- You can either use a desktop program to do this, like GitHub Desktop, or use your computers terminal - I suggest using GitHub Desktop, it's nice and friendly.
- Download and open GitHub Desktop.
- Sign in to your GitHub account.
- Click on the add repository button at the top left of the window, select 'clone' and then select the Wearables repository and click 'Clone Repository'. The Wearables repository should now appear in the left hand side of the GitHub Desktop window.
4. Create a branch from the Wearables master.
- Before making changes to code it is best practice to create a branch from the master code. Each piece of new work should go on its own branch. Create a branch by pressing the 'Add a branch' button in GitHub Desktop. This creates the branch and makes the new branch active.
5. Make Edits.
- GitHub Desktop stores files on your local computer for editing. By default the GitHub folder is inside your local home folder. Repository files will be located within a folder inside the GitHub folder.
- Navigate to the folder and open the files you would like to change in your preferred code editor.
- Save your changes.
6. Commit changes.
- When files change GitHub Desktop will notify you, stating 'x Uncommitted Changes' at the top of the GitHub window.
- Click this notification to view the changes.
- Commit the changes by giving them a name (a summary) and a description, then click the 'Commit to ...' button.
7. Add branch to Master.
- When you have finished developing code in the branch submit a 'Pull Request' in order to add the new code to the Master code. The Pull Request button is in the top right of the GitHub Desktop window.
