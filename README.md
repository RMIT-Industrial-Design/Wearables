# ThinkTank: Wearables
RMIT Digital Practice Design Studio 2018
School of Design

This repository contains code, circuits and other information that may be useful in the development and prototyping of wearable devices.
The repository supports the Think Tank: Wearables 2018 undergraduate design studio and is the collective effort of staff and students within the Industrial Design program at RMIT University. This studio investigates the body as a site of technological intervention. Looking beyond current trends of smart watches and activity trackers, we imagine a future where computing power is distributed through and across bodies, opening up new lines of communication, representation, aggregation and augmentation.
The information presented here uses Arduino and Arduino-like platforms for quick prototyping development.

This is some work I'm doing on the readme
